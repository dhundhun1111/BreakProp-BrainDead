This model uses a phrase extraction method called MOSP to extract key phrases from the original text and learns the collocation of phrases to generate a phrase sequence that meets the requirement of syntactic structure. The model also uses phrase location information to solve the rare words problem. Experimental results show that the ATSDL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both semantics and syntactic structure on two different datasets.\n",

There is a lack of consensus on chILD classification, which hinders the consolidation of research evidence. The incidence of chILD is estimated to be 0.13-16.2 cases/100,000 children/year, with a median mortality rate of 13% in developed countries. Corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine are commonly used treatments. There is a need for active disease surveillance, international patient registries, and randomized controlled intervention trials to advance the understanding and management of chILD. Additionally, studies that go beyond subjective outcomes and describe quality of life, as well as the impacts of chILD on families and health services, are necessary. Determining the burden of chILD on health services requires descriptive statistics beyond simply counting the number of cases.\n",

The review also examines different tasks in medical data analysis and provides a brief introduction to useful online resources of deep learning development tools. Deep learning has shown promising results in medical data analysis, but there are challenges such as the lack of solid theoretical basis and the need for considerable skill and experience in configuring deep networks. Furthermore, deep learning technology cannot completely replace other technologies, and exploring the combination of deep learning and traditional models can lead to new models and algorithms for large-scale problems.

      "This paper proposes a machine learning model called multimodal deep belief network (DBN) to cluster cancer patients using multi-platform observation data. The model encodes relationships among features from each input modality and fuses common features to extract a unified representation of latent features. Tests on two cancer datasets show that the approach can effectively identify meaningful disease subtypes and key genes/miRNAs that may play distinct roles in cancer pathogenesis. The model can also be used to predict missing values and drug use for each patient based on available genetic information. The approach may have practical applications in cancer pathogenesis studies and personalized cancer therapy.\n",

In our model, relationships among inherent features of each single modality are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables, and then a joint latent model is employed to fuse common features derived from multiple input modalities. A practical learning algorithm, called contrastive divergence (CD), is applied to infer the parameters of our multi-modal DBN model in an unsupervised manner. In principle, our model can be also used to predict missing values based on other variables of a cancer patient after clustering the whole dataset.

      "The paper proposes an attention-aware face recognition method based on a deep convolutional neural network and reinforcement learning. The method includes an Attention-Net that selects patches in the input face image and a Feature-Net that extracts discriminative embedding features. The Attention-Net is trained with reinforcement learning to maximize recognition accuracy, and a regularization method is introduced. The method achieves satisfactory recognition performance on a public face verification database. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of using the attention mechanism in face recognition and suggests that subdividing the face area with more points could lead to higher accuracy results.\n",

      "The study focuses on person recognition from thermal imagery and evaluates the influence of image resolution on recognition accuracy. The researchers tested if a model trained on RGB images can perform well on thermal images without additional training. They also developed a deep super-resolution model to enhance low-resolution thermal images for better recognition accuracy. The preliminary results showed that enhancing image resolution improves person recognition accuracy, and the super-resolution model improved results by 8% on the IRIS dataset. However, no gain in performance was observed on their database under strictly defined measurement conditions. The researchers plan to perform similar studies under various scenarios and evaluate the proposed approach on images with the original bit resolution.\n",

      "This systematic review examines the relationship between diabetes and the incidence of dementia. The study identified 14 eligible longitudinal population-based studies, which revealed that individuals with diabetes have a higher risk of developing dementia than those without diabetes. This risk includes both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. However, there are few detailed epidemiological data for risk factors, and the contribution of vascular disease and other comorbid conditions to dementia needs to be established. Mechanistic studies suggest that vascular disease and alterations in glucose, insulin, and amyloid metabolism underlie the pathophysiology, but it is unclear which of these mechanisms are clinically relevant. Further high-quality studies are needed to identify the risk factors and mechanisms that drive the association between diabetes and accelerated cognitive decline and dementia. Longitudinal studies that include detailed assessment of cognition, preferably in combination with neuroimaging, as well as detailed assessment of diabetes-related factors and comorbid conditions, will be best suited for this approach.\n",

The study validates the proposed model with real data and contributes to theory and practice by proposing a practical model to assist medical institutes in implementing patient scheduling more efficiently. The results show that the adaptive genetic algorithm performs better than traditional genetic algorithms and the waiting time of patients can be reduced by considering future scenarios under the base demand.

The proposed Bayesian nonparametric model captures regular content, hashtag content, and temporal information simultaneously, and Gibbs sampling is employed to infer the model parameters. A fast burn-in strategy based on temporal bursts is further introduced to speed up the model inference. In the summary ranking phase, the framework uses a learning-to-rank approach to rank social media posts in each episode.

The results support the hypothesis that iconic representations communicate specific information, including emotion, quickly and efficiently, and that this effect is driven by changes in low-level visual features in the stimuli. The authors suggest that the effective communicative role of iconic images may underlie their ubiquity and popularity in popular culture, and that further research is needed to better understand their communicative function and improve their use in various real-world applications.\n",

Lower levels of contrast and complexity within schematic stimuli were also associated with higher P1 amplitudes.

      "The article proposes a novel concept for radar-based object classification using deep learning methods. The traditional radar signal processing chain is replaced by applying deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) directly to regions-of-interest (ROI) in the radar spectrum. This approach outperforms other machine learning approaches on a novel dataset with realistic objects and demonstrates that deep learning methods can greatly augment the classification capabilities of automotive radar sensors. The article identifies deep learning challenges specific to radar classification and introduces a set of novel mechanisms that lead to significant improvements in object classification performance.

They also use a visualization technique to identify important facial regions for detecting different emotions, and show that different emotions are sensitive to different parts of the face.

To account for data scarcity, we use a modern pretrained abstractive summarizer BART (Lewis et al., 2020), which achieves 17.9 ROUGE-L as it struggles with long documents.

The deep learning model revealed a significant association between high-dimensional CT image features and EGFR genotype, offering an alternative method for non-invasive assessment of EGFR information for patients. The model requires only the raw tumour image as input and predicts EGFR mutation status directly without further human assistance, making it easy to use and very fast. The deep learning score demonstrated significant differences in EGFR-mutant and EGFR-wild type tumours. The model provides a non-invasive and easy-to-use method for EGFR mutation status prediction, which could supplement biopsy and offer a great visual interpretation to clinicians.\n",

The study applied two supervised machine learning models, a Multilayer Neural Networks (MLNN) model and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to identify COPD patients from control patients within community-based health care EMRs in Canada. The XGB model achieved an accuracy of 86% in the test dataset compared to 83% achieved by the MLNN. Feature importance analysis was used to identify a set of key symptoms from the EMR for diagnosing COPD, which included medications, health conditions, risk factors, and patient age. The study concludes that the application of the XGB model to primary care structured EMR data can identify patients with COPD from others having similar chronic conditions for disease surveillance and improve evidence-based care delivery. Future studies plan to include free-text EMR chart notes recorded by physicians during patient encounters within the primary care systems to improve care delivery and inform hospital readmission prediction of patients, thus creating improved efficiencies within the healthcare system.\n",

      "Sentiment analysis is a technique used to identify and extract subjective information such as opinions expressed in text. It is used to classify attitudes into positive, negative, or neutral categories and has many applications in various domains such as business, politics, and sociology. With the advent of social media and the growth of user-generated data, sentiment analysis has become important in disaster management. Social media can be used to determine how local crowds react during a disaster, assess the extent of devastation, and find people who are in specific need during an emergency situation. However, there are challenges in sentiment analysis such as the lack of emotional correlation information and the need for unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches. In disaster relief, more complex machine learning based approaches with stronger features are required, and leveraging psychological and sociological studies on individual behavior during disasters could be an interesting research direction. Visualization techniques also need to be improved to allow for real-time visual analytics of disaster-related posts to help first responders track changes and make quick decisions.\n",

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are two sources that provide data on fatal work-related MVTCs. However, the data sources lack either data on potential risk factors or work-relatedness confirmation and employment characteristics. Therefore, BLS and NIOSH collaborated to analyze a merged data file created by BLS using CFOI and FARS data. The matching algorithm was created to link 2010 data from CFOI and FARS using date of incident and other case characteristics, allowing for flexibility in variables to address coding discrepancies. The study has demonstrated the feasibility and value of matching data on fatal work-related MVTCs from CFOI and FARS, verifying that there are systematic differences between cases captured in both systems and those captured by CFOI alone. The findings emphasize the diversity of the members of the workforce involved in fatal work-related traffic crashes and suggest that crash prevention efforts should encompass a wide range of industries and occupations. The matching process reported in this study is the first step in a collaboration between BLS, NHTSA, and NIOSH to improve the completeness and quality of data on fatal work-related MVTCs. Matching of additional years of data is planned, and subsequent analyses will use the merged dataset to provide richer insights about risk factors for fatal work-related traffic crashes.\n",

The study found that subject-specific models predicted the moment of fracture more accurately than the homogeneous material model and had the ability to predict fracture lines with unprecedented precision. However, the modelling of post-fracture behaviour is currently unsatisfactory and needs improvement. The study identified influencing factors on skull strain energy, such as contact area, scalp thickness, and impactor positioning, and concluded that subject-specific modelling leads to a more accurate prediction of the force-displacement curve, but small variations in the computational model significantly influence the results. The study also highlighted the inability of the energy-based fracture criterion to account for differences in geometry and bone properties.\n",

However, it is not immediately clear why individuals with ASD would be disadvantaged by a dynamic presentation for just one emotion (as opposed to static images for happy or surprise)THIS article has been published in the journal of Autism and Asperger's Syndrome (ASAS), a form of autism with autism and autism without autism (ASAAS).

      "The text discusses sentiment analysis, which aims to identify opinions, emotions, and polarities from user-generated content. There are two main categories of sentiment analysis strategies, lexicon-based and corpus-based. However, both approaches require sentiment-labeled data for evaluation, which is often limited in quantity. Semisupervised learning (SSL) is a promising strategy for dealing with insufficient labeled data. This research focuses on co-training, an SSL algorithm that has not received much attention for sentiment analysis due to its restricted assumptions. The study examines four different co-training strategies and tests them against three data domains with different characteristics. The results suggest that co-training can be more effective than other currently adopted SSL methods for sentiment analysis, particularly for movie reviews. However, it showed limited improvement in other data domains, such as news articles and blog posts. Future research includes investigating co-training strategies for difficult sentiment analysis tasks and other sentiment-analysis tasks such as polarity detection and emotion classification.\n",

However, RAE methods have limitations such as generating deep parse trees and requiring a large amount of labeled data for each node. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a semi-supervised method called CHL-PRAE that combines HowNet lexicon to train a bidirectional PRAE model for sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that CHL-PRAE outperforms other approaches in sentiment classification tasks with reduced training time and computational complexity. However, the Bi-CHL-PRAE model still requires further improvement, and the optimization of syntax parse tree and HowNet Lexicon are important exploring directions in the future.\n",

      "This article discusses the importance of sentiment analysis in the context of social media and how it has become increasingly popular to gather and analyze people's reactions towards various topics. The paper explores various sentiment analysis techniques applied to Twitter data, including machine learning, ensemble approaches, and dictionary-based methods. The research outcomes demonstrate that machine learning techniques, particularly SVM and MNB, produce the greatest precision, while ensemble and hybrid-based Twitter sentiment analysis algorithms tend to perform better than supervised machine learning techniques. The article concludes that hybrid methods can obtain reasonable classification accuracy scores by combining both machine learning classifiers and lexicon-based Twitter sentiment analysis approaches.\n",

      "Sentiment analysis is a method used to extract opinions and attitudes from text, especially social media and online platforms. It involves analyzing text at a fine-grained level, such as the sentence level, to determine its polarity as positive, negative, or neutral. Various techniques have been used to analyze movie reviews, including Nave Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, Maximum Entropy, SVM, and Voted Perceptrons. From these techniques, Naive Bayesian has shown the most promising results. Additionally, sentiment analysis research overlaps with natural language processing, which addresses challenges such as irony detection and multi-lingual support. Using a Sentiment Analyzer module can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis models. To ensure the success of current models, it is important to research and verify the most beneficial methods and filter research papers. This knowledge and experience can lead to further advancements in sentiment analysis.\n",

      "The trend of social media platforms has led to an increase in fake profiles, which harms social and business entities. Existing methods for identifying fake profiles have an average accuracy of 83%, which is not accurate enough. The proposed solution is a Spark ML-based project that can predict fake profiles with higher accuracy than existing methods, with an accuracy of 93% and a 7% false positive rate. The project uses face recognition libraries and trains 70% of the profiles data on machine learning algorithms using Spark ML lib, then tests the remaining 30% data to find accuracy and predictions. The proposed solution's limitations include a false positive rate of up to 6%. Future work includes improving the method to identify fake profiles and reducing the error ratio, implementing with deep learning and bi-models to enhance fake profile recognition, and developing a user-friendly interface for non-tech users to identify fake profiles and avoid scams.\n",

They suggest that this approach could be a powerful technique to identify patients with COPD within the general population who have not been previously diagnosed. The proposed pipeline could operate in the background and flag scans identified by the pipeline as COPD. The authors suggest that their overall approach could provide useful indications to radiologists and clinicians about clinically relevant findings that could improve the diagnosis and follow-up of specific patients. The article highlights the urgent need for cost-effective strategies for case-finding of COPD, given the large proportion of undiagnosed patients.
